It's possible to cheat in multiple ways, either by something like this https://pastebin.com/e2UCKMCF or by just sending the POST request with a high number

Isn't it also a little unnecessary to send the scoreboard on each level

That's the thing, you would sort and filter it on the backend
And only send the axios request once the scoreboard shows

Move the axios request on the backend side ^^^
Fix the axios top 5 so if there are no scores to automatically put into top 5
